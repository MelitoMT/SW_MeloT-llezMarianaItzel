(Regex)saurio Ardonyx
[regex]-1914.
The "regexsaurio" (meaning "regex" "saurus"), named in 1914 is a genus of the big creature of the first half of the Jurassic. Distinctive features include a big ringed tail with tiny irregular polygons on it and large thumb spikes which are believed, were for self-deffense.
Regex was named after the geologist Regex,Paul, but the man who discovered it actually was his brother Hennam Regex. 
The scientific knowledge about the regex had evolved in several ways during the last few decades due to the new information obtained from what they call the RegexFossils.
